UDP is a fast, connectionless protocol ideal for real-time applications like streaming, gaming, and VoIP, prioritizing speed over reliability.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a streamlined networking protocol that doesnâ€™t require a connection, making it quicker and more efficient for real-time data transmission.

Unlike TCP, it doesn't guarantee reliability or data accuracy, but it's well-suited for applications such as video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP, where speed is prioritized over flawless data delivery.
